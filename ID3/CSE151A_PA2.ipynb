For each node that you draw, if it is a leaf node, write down the label that will be predicted for this node, as well as how many of the training data points lie in this node. If it is an internal node, write down the splitting rule for the node, as well as how many of the training data points lie in this node. (Hint: If your code is correct, the root node will involve the rule Feature 5 < 0.5.)"
